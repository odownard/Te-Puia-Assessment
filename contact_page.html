<!-- 
 Firstly, this first section sets up the page and connects it to css and other pages. It is one of the most important parts of the website because, without it, you cannot set up you website correctly.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Get In Touch...</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">

<body>

<!-- Next is the header and hero image section which is repeated similar on every page of the website. -->

    <header>
        <a href="index.html"><img src="./Te Puia Resources/Te-Puia-Logo.webp" alt="Te Puia Logo"></a>
        
        <nav>

            <a href="contact_page.html"><button>Get in touch...</button></a>

    </header>

    <section class="hero-image5">
        <h1 class="hero-text">Get In Touch...</h1>
    </section>

    <!-- 
    Next is the section of the page containing Te Puias contact information and links to their website. This is one of the most important parts of the website because it is the call to action calling the vistors to visit Te Puia. 
    -->

    <section id="contact-info">
        <h1>Want to know more or book in reservations?</h1>
        <h2>Head to <a href="https://www.tepuia.com">https://www.tepuia.com </a> to find out more</h2>
        <h2>Or call <span>07 348 9047</span></h2>
        <h2>To book a reservation, write to <span>reservations@tepuia.com</span></h2>
    </section>
    
<!-- Lastly, we have the footer repeated yet again even on the contact page just to hammer in the message/purpose of the website. -->

    <section id="footer">
        <h1>Like what you're seeing?</h1>
        <p>Head to <a href="https://www.tepuia.com">https://www.tepuia.com </a> to find out more</p>
        <p>Or call <span>07 348 9047</span></p>
        <p>To book a reservation, write to <span>reservations@tepuia.com</span></p>
